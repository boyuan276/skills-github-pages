Determining the "worst" NBA Finals MVP can be subjective, but a few players often come up in discussions due to their overall performance or circumstances during their Finals win.

1. **Andre Iguodala (2015)**: Iguodala won the MVP while averaging 16.3 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 4.0 assists. He was primarily credited for his defense on LeBron James. However, James still averaged 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists in that series, leading some to argue that Iguodala's impact was overstated【14†source】【15†source】.

2. **Kawhi Leonard (2014)**: Leonard averaged 17.8 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 2.0 assists in the Finals, playing a key defensive role against LeBron James. Critics argue that while Leonard was effective, he didn't lead the Spurs in any major statistical category, and his MVP selection might have been premature given his then-relatively low profile【14†source】【15†source】.

3. **Jerry West (1969)**: Jerry West remains the only player to win Finals MVP on a losing team, averaging 37.9 points, 4.7 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game. Despite his stellar performance, the Lakers lost to the Celtics, which has led to debates about whether the award should go to a player whose team didn't win the championship【14†source】【15†source】.

These players are not deemed "bad" by any means, but their MVP selections are often debated due to the context and contributions of their teammates or opponents during those Finals series.
